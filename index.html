			<h2>Me</h2>
			<h3>I like to make cool things</h3>
			<p>
				What do I mean by that? for as long as I can remember, I've been drawing things and making art projects. I've also been fascinated by new gadgets and figuring out all of the things they can do. For me, working on projects that combine these two passions is the most rewarding experience.
			</p>
			<h3>Where does the web come in?</h3>
			<p>
				It's the best place to explore these things! Different design trends are always emerging, and there's always a new technology to learn about. Plus, it's fun to make new things and the web provides an easy way to share them with the rest of the world.
			</p>
			<h3>Anything else?</h3>
			<p>
				When I'm not working on projects, I'm probably bothering my friends with facebook stickers. When I'm offline, you can usually find me cooking, drawing, and badly playing the ukulele
